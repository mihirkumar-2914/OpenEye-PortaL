PROJECT NAME: OpenEye 


ABOUT:The track we have chosen is open innovation. Citizens often face difficulties such as government negligence, police misconduct, or everyday civic issues (like broken roads, sanitation, or corruption). However, fear of retaliation, social stigma, or lack of trust prevents many from voicing their concerns openly. As a result, countless problems remain unreported and unresolved, reducing accountability and weakening public trust in the system.
There is a need for a secure and anonymous complaint platform where individuals can freely report issues without fear of exposure, while ensuring authenticity and enabling authorities or communities to take action. And hence our team Techspire has innovated OpenEye which helps the people in reporting their concerns to the government without revealing their true identity which is the main crux of our portal . It acts as a bridge between the government and public . Public can report their concerns and the government authorities active can take action accordingly .
